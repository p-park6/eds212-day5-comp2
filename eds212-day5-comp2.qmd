# Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)
-   !=(do these not match?)
-   >, <, >=, <=
-   & (and), | (or)
```{r}
#does 4 match 5? (no)
4 == 5

#does 4 match 4 (yes)
4 == 4

#does 4 not match 5? (yes)
4 != 5

#does 4 match "4"?
4 == "4"

#with assigned variables:
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog

#is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20
dog > cat | cat < 20

#Is dog less than cat AND cat == 10
dog < cat & cat == 10
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#usually you want to run at the beginning but i am lazy so here you are lol
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = mpg, color = wt)) + 
  labs(x = "car weight (in thousands of pounds", y = "miles per gallon(mpg)", title = "weight vs mpg")
```
